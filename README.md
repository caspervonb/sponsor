# Deno Sponsor's Toolkit

Hello there!

This is the Deno Sponsor's Toolkit which is a collection of tools that I've
made just for *you* my awesome [sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/caspervonb).

## Getting Started

You can install sponsor by running the following command:

```shell
deno install --allow-all --unstable https://deno.land/x/sponsor
```

## What's Inside?

Only every feature you've ever wanted and then some (eventually)!
