**Hello there!**

This is my sponsor's toolbox which is a collection of tools that I've
made just for *you* my awesome [sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/caspervonb).

## What's Inside?

Every feature you've ever wanted in the Deno command line interface and then
some you did not know you wanted.

This serves as a playground for things I may implement in Deno at some point in
time and things that just doesn't make sense to put into Deno like tooling for
web browsers.

## Getting Started

You can install sponsor by running the following command:

```shell
deno install --allow-all --unstable https://deno.land/x/sponsor/main.js
```

There is also a canary version available, which you can install with this command:

```shell
deno install --allow-all --unstable https://sponsor.land/main.js
```

## Usage

Run a test suite in headless Chrome:

```shell
sponsor test --headless --browser chrome
```

Run a test suite in headless Firefox:

```shell
sponsor test --headless --browser firefox
```
